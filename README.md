The diagram illustrates the use cases for the Expeso WebApp, highlighting the various interactions available to users. A key feature is the dashboard, which offers a comprehensive analysis of expenses and budgeting data. This dashboard showcases key financial metrics, providing insights to help users monitor their spending patterns and overall financial health.

Users can also manage expenses by creating, editing, or deleting entries, and they can view their expense history in detail. The system allows for setting a budget to track spending limits, and users can generate financial reports for further analysis. Additionally, users have the option to export data for external use or further auditing.
